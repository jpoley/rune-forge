# Security Scanning Configuration
#
# This file configures security scanning behavior for your repository.
# Place this file at: .github/security-config.yml
#
# Used by: .github/workflows/security-scan.yml

security:
  # Severity level that will cause the scan to fail
  # Options: critical, high, medium, low
  # Default: critical (recommended - only critical vulnerabilities trigger failure)
  #
  # Note: Only single severity is currently supported.
  # Multi-severity (e.g., "critical,high") is planned for future release.
  fail-on: critical

  # Whether to upload SARIF results to GitHub Security tab
  # This enables viewing findings in the repository's Security > Code scanning alerts
  upload-sarif: true

  # Path to scan (relative to repository root)
  # Use "." for entire repository or specify a subdirectory
  # Examples:
  #   scan-path: "."           # Scan entire repository
  #   scan-path: "src/"        # Scan only src directory
  #   scan-path: "backend/"    # Scan only backend directory
  scan-path: "."

# =============================================================================
# Advanced Configuration (Optional)
# =============================================================================
#
# For larger repositories, consider using the parallel scanning workflow
# instead of the standard security-scan.yml workflow.
#
# See: templates/github-actions/security-parallel.yml
#
# Parallel scanning is recommended for:
# - Codebases > 500K lines of code
# - Monorepos with multiple components
# - Projects requiring faster scan times
#
# Benefits:
# - 3x faster scanning via matrix strategy
# - Component-specific SARIF categories
# - Aggregated results across all components
# =============================================================================
