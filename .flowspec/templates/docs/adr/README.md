# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains ADRs generated by `/flow:plan`.

## Purpose

ADRs capture significant architectural decisions, their context, and consequences using the Nygard format.

## File Naming Convention

```
{NNN}-{decision-slug}.md
```

**Examples:**
- `001-use-postgresql-for-persistence.md`
- `002-adopt-event-sourcing.md`
- `003-select-react-for-frontend.md`

## Template

See `templates/adr-template.md` for the standard ADR format.

## Required Sections (Nygard Format)

1. Title (with ADR number)
2. Status (Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded)
3. Context
4. Decision
5. Consequences (Positive/Negative)
6. Alternatives Considered (optional but recommended)

## Validation

ADRs are validated by `ADRValidator` for:
- Sequential numbering
- Required Nygard sections
- Status field presence

## Workflow

1. Run `/flow:plan` to generate architectural decisions
2. ADRs are created in this directory
3. Review and approve architectural decisions
4. Proceed to implementation phase

## ADR Lifecycle

```
Proposed → Accepted → [Deprecated|Superseded]
```

- **Proposed**: Under review
- **Accepted**: Approved and in effect
- **Deprecated**: No longer applies
- **Superseded**: Replaced by newer ADR (reference it)
