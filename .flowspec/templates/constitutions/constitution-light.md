# [PROJECT_NAME] Constitution
<!-- TIER: Light - Minimal controls for startups/hobby projects -->
<!-- NEEDS_VALIDATION: Project name -->

## Core Principles

### Simplicity First
Keep things simple. Ship fast, iterate quickly. Avoid over-engineering.

### Working Software
Prioritize working software over documentation. Code that runs is better than perfect designs.

### Pragmatic Quality
<!-- SECTION:QUALITY:BEGIN -->
<!-- NEEDS_VALIDATION: Quality standards appropriate for your project -->
- Write tests for critical paths
- Fix bugs before adding features
- Code review when time permits
<!-- SECTION:QUALITY:END -->

## Development Workflow

### Git Practices
<!-- SECTION:GIT:BEGIN -->
<!-- NEEDS_VALIDATION: Git workflow matches team size -->
- Feature branches encouraged for all changes
- Direct commits to main allowed if you prefer ("yolo mode")
- Commit messages should be descriptive
- DCO sign-off required (automated via git hooks): `git commit -s`
<!-- SECTION:GIT:END -->

### Task Management
<!-- SECTION:TASKS:BEGIN -->
<!-- NEEDS_VALIDATION: Task tracking approach -->
Tasks should have:
- Clear description of what needs to be done
- Basic acceptance criteria when scope is unclear
<!-- SECTION:TASKS:END -->

## Technology Stack
<!-- SECTION:TECH_STACK:BEGIN -->
<!-- NEEDS_VALIDATION: Populate with detected languages/frameworks -->
[LANGUAGES_AND_FRAMEWORKS]
<!-- SECTION:TECH_STACK:END -->

## Governance

This constitution is a living document. Update it as the project evolves.
