# Security Report Guidelines

This document defines standards for generating security audit reports in Flowspec. These guidelines ensure consistency, clarity, and actionability across all security reports.

## Document Purpose

Security audit reports serve multiple audiences:
- **Executives**: Need business impact and risk summary
- **Developers**: Need technical details and remediation steps
- **Security Team**: Need compliance status and vulnerability tracking
- **Auditors**: Need evidence for compliance requirements

## Security Posture Calculation

The security posture is the top-level indicator of codebase security health.

### Posture Levels

| Posture | Definition | Criteria | Action Required |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------------|
| **SECURE** | No known vulnerabilities of concern | Zero critical vulnerabilities AND zero high vulnerabilities | Routine maintenance and monitoring |
| **CONDITIONAL** | Minor issues that require planning | Zero critical AND zero high, but one or more medium/low vulnerabilities | Schedule remediation in normal sprint planning |
| **AT RISK** | Critical vulnerabilities requiring immediate action | One or more critical OR high severity vulnerabilities | Immediate remediation required, consider deployment freeze |

### Calculation Formula

```python
def calculate_security_posture(findings):
    critical_count = count_by_severity(findings, "critical")
    high_count = count_by_severity(findings, "high")
    medium_count = count_by_severity(findings, "medium")
    low_count = count_by_severity(findings, "low")

    if critical_count > 0 or high_count > 0:
        return "AT RISK"
    elif medium_count > 0 or low_count > 0:
        return "CONDITIONAL"
    else:
        return "SECURE"
```

### Posture Overrides

In rare cases, security posture can be overridden if:
- Vulnerability is not exploitable in production environment (e.g., dev-only code)
- Compensating controls fully mitigate the risk
- Risk has been formally accepted by security team and documented

**Override must include:**
- Justification for override
- Approver name and date
- Compensating controls in place
- Re-evaluation date

## Severity Classification

### CVSS Score Mapping

| Severity | CVSS Score Range | Description | Example Vulnerabilities |
|----------|------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Critical** | 9.0 - 10.0 | Complete system compromise possible | SQL injection with admin access, Remote Code Execution |
| **High** | 7.0 - 8.9 | Significant data exposure or privilege escalation | XSS in admin panel, Authentication bypass |
| **Medium** | 4.0 - 6.9 | Limited data exposure or DoS | Missing security headers, Information disclosure |
| **Low** | 0.1 - 3.9 | Minor issues, configuration problems | Verbose error messages, Outdated dependencies (no CVE) |
| **Informational** | 0.0 | No security impact | Best practice recommendations |

### Severity Adjustment Factors

Adjust CVSS score based on:

**Increase Severity:**
- Vulnerability in authentication/authorization code
- PII or sensitive data involved
- Publicly exposed endpoint
- High likelihood of exploitation

**Decrease Severity:**
- Requires authenticated access
- Limited to internal network
- Compensating controls in place
- Low likelihood of exploitation

## OWASP Top 10 (2021) Categories

### Category Reference

| ID | Category | Description |
|----|----------|-------------|
| **A01** | Broken Access Control | Users accessing unauthorized functions/data |
| **A02** | Cryptographic Failures | Weak encryption or plaintext sensitive data |
| **A03** | Injection | Untrusted data sent to interpreter |
| **A04** | Insecure Design | Missing security controls in design |
| **A05** | Security Misconfiguration | Incorrect security settings |
| **A06** | Vulnerable and Outdated Components | Using vulnerable dependencies |
| **A07** | Identification and Authentication Failures | Weak authentication mechanisms |
| **A08** | Software and Data Integrity Failures | Missing integrity verification |
| **A09** | Security Logging and Monitoring Failures | Insufficient security event logging |
| **A10** | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | Fetching remote resource without URL validation |

### Mapping Vulnerabilities to OWASP

When analyzing a finding, determine which OWASP category applies:

**Examples:**
- SQL Injection → A03 (Injection)
- Missing authorization check → A01 (Broken Access Control)
- Hardcoded password → A02 (Cryptographic Failures)
- Outdated library with CVE → A06 (Vulnerable Components)
- No audit logging → A09 (Logging Failures)

**Multiple Categories:**
Some vulnerabilities map to multiple categories. Choose the **primary** category based on root cause.

## CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) Mapping

Common CWE IDs to include:

| CWE | Name | OWASP |
|-----|------|-------|
| CWE-89 | SQL Injection | A03 |
| CWE-79 | Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) | A03 |
| CWE-78 | OS Command Injection | A03 |
| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | A07 |
| CWE-285 | Improper Authorization | A01 |
| CWE-798 | Hardcoded Credentials | A02 |
| CWE-327 | Weak Crypto Algorithm | A02 |
| CWE-611 | XXE Injection | A03 |
| CWE-918 | SSRF | A10 |
| CWE-502 | Deserialization of Untrusted Data | A08 |

### Detailed Findings (Required)

**Per-Finding Template:**
```markdown
### [VULN-001] SQL Injection in Login Endpoint

**Severity:** Critical
**CVSS Score:** 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
**CWE:** CWE-89 (SQL Injection)
**OWASP:** A03 (Injection)
**Status:** Open

**Description:**
The login endpoint in `src/auth/login.py` constructs SQL queries using string concatenation
with unsanitized user input. An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code to bypass authentication
or extract sensitive data from the database.

**Location:**
- File: `src/auth/login.py:45`
- Function: `authenticate_user()`
- Component: Authentication Service

**Impact:**
- Complete authentication bypass
- Unauthorized access to all user accounts
- Potential data exfiltration of entire database
- Compliance violation (GDPR, SOC2)

**Proof of Concept:**
```python
# Malicious input
username = "admin' OR '1'='1' --"
password = "anything"

# Results in SQL:
# SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR '1'='1' --' AND password = 'anything'
# This bypasses authentication
```

**Remediation:**
1. Replace string concatenation with parameterized queries:
   ```python
   cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?", (username, hashed_password))
   ```
2. Implement input validation on username field (alphanumeric only, max 50 chars)
3. Add rate limiting to login endpoint (5 attempts per IP per minute)
4. Add security test to verify fix

**Effort Estimate:** 2-4 hours
**Priority:** P0 (Immediate)
**Recommended Owner:** Backend Team

**References:**
- [CWE-89: SQL Injection](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
- [OWASP SQL Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection)
```

## Compliance and Audit Requirements

### Audit Trail

Every security audit report must include:
- **Report Version:** Semantic versioning (1.0, 1.1, 2.0)
- **Generated Date:** ISO 8601 timestamp
- **Assessor:** Name or system that generated report
- **Input Data Sources:** Links to scan-results.json, triage-results.json

### Version Control

- Store all reports in Git for version history
- Use conventional commit messages: `docs(security): add audit report for feature-x`
- Tag significant reports: `security-audit-v1.0`

### Retention Policy

- Keep audit reports for minimum 3 years for compliance
- Archive reports in `docs/security/archive/YYYY-MM/` after 1 year
- Update reports as vulnerabilities are remediated (track status changes)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Severity Inflation:** Don't label everything as Critical to get attention
2. **Vague Remediation:** "Fix the vulnerability" is not helpful
3. **Missing Context:** Always include file location and line number
4. **Ignoring False Positives:** Verify findings before reporting
5. **Technical Jargon in Executive Summary:** Use business language
6. **Unrealistic Timelines:** Consider team capacity and priorities
7. **Incomplete OWASP Mapping:** All 10 categories must be addressed
8. **No Follow-up Plan:** Include re-scan recommendations

## Report Maintenance

### Updating Reports

When vulnerabilities are remediated:
1. Update finding status from "Open" to "Remediated"
2. Add remediation date and verification method
3. Recalculate security posture
4. Update OWASP compliance checklist
5. Increment report version (1.0 → 1.1)

### Re-scanning

After remediation:
1. Re-run security scans
2. Verify vulnerabilities are fixed
3. Generate updated audit report
4. Compare before/after metrics
