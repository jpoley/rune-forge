## Issue Categories

### 1. Module-Level Imports (3 issues)

**Problem**: Imports placed inside methods instead of at module level.

**Files affected**:
- `base.py:105` - `import json` inside `_parse_llm_response`
- `engine.py:259` - `import json` inside `_generate_ai_explanation`
- `hardcoded_secrets.py:128` - `import math` inside `_calculate_entropy`

**Why it matters**:
- Violates Python conventions (PEP 8)
- Reduces code readability
- May cause repeated import overhead (though Python caches)
- Makes dependencies less obvious

**Rule to add**:
> All imports MUST be at module level, never inside functions/methods. The only exception is for breaking circular imports, which should be rare and documented.

---

### 2. Pattern Matching Too Broad (4 issues)

**Problem**: Heuristic patterns that match unintended cases.

**Examples**:
- `sql_injection.py:37` - Pattern `"?"` matches ANY question mark, not just SQL placeholders
- `hardcoded_secrets.py:115` - Regex `r'["\']([^"\']+)["\']'` matches ANY quoted string
- `path_traversal.py:44` - `path.join` listed as safe, but it doesn't prevent traversal
- `weak_crypto.py:68` - Checksum detection matches "hash" inside "password_hash"

**Why it matters**:
- False positives/negatives degrade classifier accuracy
- Security tools must be precise to be trusted
- Broad patterns create hard-to-debug classification errors

**Rules to add**:
> When writing pattern-matching heuristics:
> 1. Consider what ELSE could match the pattern besides the intended target
> 2. Add context requirements (same line, specific surrounding patterns)
> 3. Use negative patterns to exclude known false matches
> 4. Test with adversarial examples that look similar but aren't

---

### 3. Early Return Logic Flaws (2 issues)

**Problem**: Returning early when finding one condition without checking for conflicting conditions.

**Examples**:
- `xss.py:57` - Returns FALSE_POSITIVE on first safe pattern, ignoring dangerous patterns
- `path_traversal.py:73` - Can't verify validation is applied before file operation

**Why it matters**:
- Code that sanitizes one input may still be vulnerable with another
- Validation must be applied to the specific operation being analyzed
- Early returns hide the complexity of real code

**Rule to add**:
> In security classifiers, NEVER return early on a single pattern. Always:
> 1. Collect ALL matching patterns (safe and dangerous)
> 2. Check for conflicting patterns before classifying
> 3. When both safe and dangerous patterns exist, return NEEDS_INVESTIGATION
> 4. Consider data flow, not just pattern presence

---

### 4. Missing Error Context (1 issue)

**Problem**: Exception handlers that hide error details.

**Example**:
- `base.py:140` - Catches parsing errors but doesn't log the actual error

**Why it matters**:
- Debugging LLM prompt issues requires seeing what went wrong
- Silent failures make production issues hard to diagnose
- Losing error context violates observability principles

**Rule to add**:
> Exception handlers MUST:
> 1. Log the actual exception with context using `logger.warning()` or `logger.error()`
> 2. Include relevant data (truncated to reasonable size)
> 3. Return error details in user-facing messages when appropriate

---

### 5. Path Handling Issues (2 issues)

**Problem**: File path operations that fail in real repositories.

**Examples**:
- `risk_scorer.py:148` - Git blame uses basename from parent dir, fails if git root differs
- `risk_scorer.py:148` - File paths could contain shell metacharacters

**Why it matters**:
- Real projects have deep directory structures
- Git root is often different from file's parent directory
- Path operations must work across diverse environments

**Rule to add**:
> For any file-system operations:
> 1. Use absolute paths resolved from a known root
> 2. Find the actual git root, don't assume it's the file's parent
> 3. Use paths relative to git root for git commands
> 4. Validate/sanitize paths before use in shell commands

---

### 6. Test Comment Accuracy (1 issue)

**Problem**: Test docstrings that don't accurately describe what's being tested.

**Example**:
- `test_models.py:47` - Comment says "detection_time clamped" but the stored value isn't modified

**Why it matters**:
- Misleading comments cause confusion during maintenance
- Tests document expected behavior - inaccuracy spreads misinformation
- Future developers may misunderstand the API contract

**Rule to add**:
> Test docstrings MUST accurately describe:
> 1. What behavior is being tested
> 2. What is/isn't modified by the operation
> 3. The distinction between input values and computed properties

---

### 7. Sequential Processing (2 issues noted but not fixed)

**Problem**: Processing items one at a time when parallelization is possible.

**Examples**:
- `engine.py:124` - Sequential triage of findings
- `engine.py:257` - Sequential LLM calls for explanations

**Why it matters**:
- LLM calls are slow; 100 findings = 100 sequential calls
- Independent operations can run in parallel
- Poor performance degrades user experience

**Note**: Not fixed in this PR as it requires async refactoring. Consider for future optimization.

- [ ] Both positive and negative patterns considered
- [ ] Exceptions logged with context
- [ ] File paths use git root, not assumed directories
- [ ] Test comments accurately describe behavior
- [ ] Consider data flow, not just pattern presence
