# Flowspec Workflow Configuration
# ==============================================================================
#
# This file defines the state machine for /flowspec command workflows in
# Spec-Driven Development (SDD). It is the authoritative source for:
#
#   - Task states: Valid progression states in the development lifecycle
#   - Workflows: /flowspec slash commands with agent assignments
#   - Transitions: State changes with artifact validation gates
#   - Agent loops: Inner/outer loop classification for execution model
#
# Configuration Version: 1.1
# Compatible with: flowspec v0.0.136+
#
# References:
#   - docs/reference/artifact-path-patterns.md
#   - docs/reference/agent-loop-classification.md

version: "1.1"

# ==============================================================================
# TASK STATES
# ==============================================================================
# Valid states a task can occupy during the development lifecycle.
# States progress forward via workflows, with manual transitions to "Done".

states:
  - "To Do"           # Initial state - work has not started
  - "Assessed"        # SDD workflow suitability evaluated via /flow:assess
  - "Specified"       # Requirements captured via /flow:specify
  - "Researched"      # Technical and business research completed via /flow:research
  - "Planned"         # Architecture and infrastructure planned via /flow:plan
  - "In Implementation"  # Code actively being written via /flow:implement
  - "Validated"       # QA, security, and documentation validated via /flow:validate
  - "Deployed"        # Released to production via /flow:operate
  - "Done"            # Work complete - ready for archive

# ==============================================================================
# WORKFLOW DEFINITIONS
# ==============================================================================
# Each workflow maps to a /flowspec slash command.

# ==============================================================================
# STATE TRANSITIONS
# ==============================================================================
# Transitions define the state machine edges with artifact validation gates.
#
# Artifact Path Variables:
#   {feature}  - Feature name slug (e.g., "user-authentication")
#   {NNN}      - Zero-padded number (e.g., "001")
#   {slug}     - Title slug
#
# Validation Modes:
#   NONE         - Automatic transition after artifacts created
#   KEYWORD[...] - User must type exact keyword to proceed
#   PULL_REQUEST - Blocked until PR containing artifact is merged
