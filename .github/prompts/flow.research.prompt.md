description: Execute research and business validation workflow using specialized agents.
loop: outer
# Loop Classification: OUTER LOOP
# This command is part of the outer loop (planning/design phase). It conducts research
# and business validation to inform feature design and planning decisions.
---

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Light Mode Check

**IMPORTANT**: First check if this project is in light mode:

```bash
# Check for light mode marker
if [ -f ".flowspec-light-mode" ]; then
  echo "LIGHT MODE DETECTED"
  # Stop here - research is skipped in light mode
else
  echo "FULL MODE - Proceeding with research"
  # Continue with standard research workflow
fi
```

**If `.flowspec-light-mode` exists**, inform the user and DO NOT proceed:

```text
ℹ️ This project is in Light Mode - /flow:research is SKIPPED

Light mode provides a streamlined ~60% faster workflow by skipping the research
phase. This is appropriate for medium-complexity features (4-6/10).

Your options:
  1. Run /flow:plan to proceed directly to planning
  2. To enable research, delete .flowspec-light-mode and use full mode
     (See docs/guides/when-to-use-light-mode.md for upgrade instructions)

Current workflow path: Specified -> Planned (skipping Researched)
```

**If NOT in light mode**, continue with the standard research workflow below.

## Execution Instructions

This command orchestrates comprehensive research and business validation using two specialized agents working sequentially.

{{INCLUDE:.claude/commands/flow/_constitution-check.md}}

{{INCLUDE:.claude/commands/flow/_workflow-state.md}}

**For /flow:research**: Required input state is `workflow:Specified`. Output state will be `workflow:Researched`.

If the task doesn't have the required workflow state, inform the user:
- If task needs specification first: suggest running `/flow:specify`
- If research needs to be done before specification: explain that this violates the workflow

### Extended Thinking Mode

> **🧠 Megathink**: Comprehensive research requires deep analysis across multiple dimensions. Apply extended thinking to:
> - Technology landscape and emerging trends
> - Competitive positioning and market dynamics
> - Long-term feasibility and risk assessment
> - Integration options and architectural implications

**IMPORTANT: Before starting, check for existing research-related tasks:**

```bash
# Search for research tasks
backlog search "research" --plain
backlog search "$ARGUMENTS" --plain

# List all research tasks
backlog task list -l research --plain
```

Review any existing tasks before proceeding. If relevant tasks exist, coordinate with them or update them instead of duplicating work.

### Phase 1: Research

Use the Task tool to launch a **general-purpose** agent with the following prompt (includes full Researcher context):

  --ac "Analyze financial viability (revenue model, cost structure, unit economics)" \
  --ac "Assess operational feasibility (resources, capabilities, gaps)" \
  --ac "Evaluate strategic fit (organizational alignment)" \
  --ac "Complete risk analysis and mitigation (market, execution, financial risks)" \
  --ac "Provide Go/No-Go/Proceed-with-Caution recommendation" \
  -l validation,business \
  --priority high
```

   ```

3. **Mark ACs as you complete each validation area:**
   ```bash
   backlog task edit <id> --check-ac 1  # After market assessment
   backlog task edit <id> --check-ac 2  # After financial analysis
   # etc.
   ```

4. **Add validation findings as implementation notes:**

   ```

# TASK: Based on the research findings provided, conduct a comprehensive business validation assessment for: [USER INPUT TOPIC]

Research Context:
[PASTE RESEARCH FINDINGS FROM PHASE 1]

Provide detailed validation covering:
1. **Market Opportunity Assessment** (TAM, SAM, SOM with realistic numbers)
2. **Financial Viability Analysis** (revenue model, cost structure, unit economics)
3. **Operational Feasibility** (resource requirements, capability gaps)
4. **Strategic Fit Analysis** (organizational alignment, portfolio strategy)
5. **Risk Analysis and Mitigation** (market, execution, financial, strategic risks)

Deliver a structured validation report with:
- **Executive Assessment** (Go/No-Go/Proceed with Caution recommendation with confidence level)
- **Detailed Opportunity Score** (1-10 across key dimensions with justification)
- **Strengths and Opportunities** (genuine competitive advantages)
- **Weaknesses and Threats** (real challenges and limitations)
- **Critical Assumptions** (assumptions that must be true, validation methods)
- **Risk Register** (probability, impact, mitigation for each risk)
- **Financial Projections Review** (base case, upside, downside scenarios)
- **Recommendations and Next Steps** (validation actions, experiments, decision criteria)
```

### Final Output

Consolidate both reports into a comprehensive research and validation package that enables informed decision-making.

### ⚠️ MANDATORY: Design->Implement Workflow

**This is a DESIGN command. Research tasks MUST create implementation tasks before completion.**

After the research and business validation agents complete their work:

1. **Create implementation tasks** based on research findings and recommendations:
   ```bash
   # Example: Create tasks from research recommendations
   backlog task create "Implement [Recommended Solution]" \
     -d "Implementation based on research findings from /flow:research" \
     --ac "Implement approach recommended in research report" \
     --ac "Address feasibility concerns identified in validation" \
     --ac "Monitor metrics identified in business case" \
     -l implement,research-followup \
     --priority high

   backlog task create "Technical Spike: [Validate Key Assumption]" \
     -d "Validation spike based on research critical assumptions" \
     --ac "Validate assumption X from research report" \
     --ac "Document findings and update implementation plan" \
     -l spike,research-followup
   ```

2. **Update research task notes** with follow-up references:
   ```bash
   backlog task edit <research-task-id> --append-notes $'Research Outcome: Go/No-Go/Proceed with Caution\n\nFollow-up Implementation Tasks:\n- task-XXX: Implement recommended solution\n- task-YYY: Validation spike for assumption A'
   ```

3. **Only then mark the research task as Done**

**Research without actionable follow-up tasks provides no value. Every research effort must produce implementation direction.**

**Note**: If research concludes with "No-Go" recommendation, create a documentation task to record the decision and rationale for future reference.

## Post-Completion: Emit Workflow Event

After successfully completing this command (research and validation reports generated), emit the workflow event:

```bash
flowspec hooks emit research.completed \
  --spec-id "$FEATURE_ID" \
  --task-id "$TASK_ID" \
  -f docs/research/$FEATURE_ID-research.md \
  -f docs/research/$FEATURE_ID-validation.md
```

Replace `$FEATURE_ID` with the feature name/identifier and `$TASK_ID` with the backlog task ID if available.

This triggers any configured hooks in `.flowspec/hooks/hooks.yaml` (e.g., notifications, quality gates).
