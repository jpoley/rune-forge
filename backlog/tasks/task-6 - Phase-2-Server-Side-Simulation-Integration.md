## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Move game simulation execution to server with action validation and state management
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Import simulation package into server
- [ ] #2 Server-side executeAction implementation
- [ ] #3 Action validation layer (turn ownership, valid moves)
- [ ] #4 State management per session
- [ ] #5 Event generation from action execution
- [ ] #6 No simulation changes required (purity preserved)
